# ReactNative-FavoriteRestaurant

This app is saving my favorite restaurant.<br/>
I made three screens: Main Screen, Add Screen, Detail Screen.<br/>

If you launched app, app asked location permission.<br/>

Main Screen show my location and saved favorite restaurant.
My location is marked red pin, favorite restaurant is marked blud pin.<br/>
When you long press on map, your location change.
And If you click on address under app bottom, after you move to Add Screen, you add a new favorite restaurant.<br/>

After you write title about this location, if you click save button, add a favorite restaurant in map.<br/>

If you click favorite restaurant in map, you move to Detail Sreen<br/>
